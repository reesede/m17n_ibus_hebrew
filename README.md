# m17n_ibus_hebrew

## Introduction

Provides an input method for Ibus for Biblical Hebrew based on the SIL phonetic keyboard.

## Installation

To install, move the coptic.mim file to ~/.m17n.d and restart Ibus. The input method should show up in Preferences->Input Method->Add->Other->coptic (m17n).

Note that this input method uses the ALTGR key, which may need to be set up depending on
the GUI (KDE, Gnome, etc.). With KDE, it can be set up in System Settings > Input Devices > Keyboard > Advanced.
